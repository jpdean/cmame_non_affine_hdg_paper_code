# Supplementary material for “Design and analysis of an exactly divergence-free hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method for incompressible flows on meshes with quadrilateral cells”

This repository contains the code used in the numerical examples.

# Running the code
The code relies on the mixed domain functionality in FEniCSx, which is still under development and has not been merged into FEniCSx main yet. For details on installing FEniCSx with mixed domain functionality, please see the instructions given [here](https://github.com/jpdean/mixed_domain_demos/tree/main).
